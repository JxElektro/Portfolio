> CodeX Chatbot

CodeX Chatbot is a simple chatbot application that uses the OpenAI API to generate text completions. It can be used to respond to user messages and generate helpful responses. This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development and to showcase my skills.

> Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenAI API
- Body-parser middleware
- CORS middleware

### How It Works
CodeX Chatbot works by sending a message received from a POST request to the OpenAI API, which generates a text completion based on the message and a given context. The generated text is then sent back to the user as a response. The chatbot uses the text-davinci-003 OpenAI model, which is capable of generating high-quality text completions.

### Future Improvements
Here are some improvements that can be made to the project in the future:

- Implement user authentication and session management to keep track of user contexts
- Add more OpenAI models and allow users to choose which model to use
- Implement natural language processing to allow for more human-like conversations
> Conclusion

CodeX Chatbot is a simple yet effective demonstration of how the OpenAI API can be used to generate text completions. I have learned a lot from building this project and I hope it serves as an example of my skills as a web developer.
